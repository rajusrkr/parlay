## How many schemas do I need?
1. user
2. admin
3. market
4. order
5. position
---
Currently in the schema folder I have 7 schemas, two extras 1.pl, 2.price.

I can easily add pl in position and I can use the updated from order schema. By doing this I Can delete two schemas.

#### Delete:
1. pl
2. price

#### Update:
1. add pl in position schema
2. get latest/old/all time prices from order schema
